# Contributing to Kapunka UI

Thanks for helping build the Kapunka experience. To keep the interface cohesive, follow these steps **before writing code**:

1. **Read `DESIGN.md`.** Every UI/UX change must be vetted against the principles documented there. If you’re about to introduce a new pattern or tweak an existing one, skim the relevant sections first. If the change alters our foundations, update `DESIGN.md` in the same PR.
2. Review the component-specific files you plan to edit (`kapunka.css`, `css/components.css`, `kapunka.js`, template parts, etc.) so you understand existing behaviors.
3. When opening a PR, add a checklist item confirming you re-read `DESIGN.md` and adhered to it.

Keeping the design guide as part of our workflow ensures every contribution respects the Kapunka visual language we’ve established.
